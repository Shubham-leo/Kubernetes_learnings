# Phase 2: Configuration & Storage

## What you'll learn
In Phase 1 you deployed apps. Now you'll learn how to **configure them** and **store data**.

## Learning Order

| # | Topic | What You'll Learn |
|---|-------|-------------------|
| 01 | ConfigMaps | Pass configuration to pods (non-sensitive) |
| 02 | Secrets | Pass sensitive data (passwords, API keys) |
| 03 | Volumes | Persistent storage - data survives pod restarts |
| 04 | Probes | Health checks - K8s knows if your app is healthy |
| 05 | Resource Limits | CPU/memory limits - prevent pods from eating all resources |

## Prerequisites
- Phase 1 completed
- Minikube running (`minikube status`)

Start with `01-configmaps/` and go in order!
